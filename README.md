A **S**oftware **D**efined **R**adio development board.

Initial project codename **Icy**radio originated from the device family name of the FPGA used in the [first version](https://github.com/vankxr/icyradio/tree/v1/qo100) (**ICE**40). Coincidently, the device family name of the FPGA used in this version (Artix) also resembles a very cold region, the Arctic, hence, the project codename still holds some of its sense :blush:.

## Functional block diagram

#### v2
**Note: From v2 onwards, the only components in this repository are hardware related, no specific application software, like in v1 branches. Applications that use this hardware are kept in a separate repository (TODO: Add link)**
The goal of this project is to develop a flexible and feature rich SDR platform for tinkering. It will include, among other features, a mmWave synthesizer controlled by software to allow external mixers to be attached to the SDR and extend its frequency range (i.e. for 5G applications), and also allow interfacing to a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 for standalone operation.

## Dependencies

## Errata
 - The WP pin of the LT7182S regulator was left floating, with a placeholder resistor for pulling it up later, assuming it had an internal pulldown. Turns out it is floating, and thus it can be sampled internally as 1, write-protecting the device and forbidding configuration commands. A quick fix is to scrape a tiny bit of the ground plane near the WP resistor (R1120) pad, and shunting it to GND there with a blob of solder. The figure below exemplifies the process. The solder blob is marked in blue.

 - The FPGA INIT and DONE LED markings on the PCB are swapped (oops). In the picture below, it can be seen that D202 connects to the FPGA_DONE signal, yet it's labelled INIT. The FPGA_INIT signal connects to D201, and is labelled as DONE. It is merely an aesthetic problem, and does not affect functionality at all!
